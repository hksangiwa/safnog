								   Unfortunately, the preparation for SAFNOG-6, initially scheduled for the September, 2020, has not been spared, as the pandemic has made logistical planning uncertain amongst our sponsors, supporters and venues. To this end, we have made the rather difficult, but responsible, decision to defer the SAFNOG-6 meeting to 20th - 22nd September, 2021, in order to ensure that safety and health comes first.

								  SAFNOG would also like to take this opportunity to encourage its and other Network Operators Groups members to actively use and increase their participation on this and other mailing lists around the world, as the learning and engagement process never ends; and in fact, is probably more crucial in these times. The operational community can continue to exist successfully even throughout this period of social distancing.
